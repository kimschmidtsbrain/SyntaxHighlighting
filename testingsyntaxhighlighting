# Trying Code Coloring
1. Create Fenced Code Block First
>>>Standard Markdown is done by surrounding text with with 4 spaces at beginning of each line
>>>Fenced Code in GFM is ``` code ```
>>>>>>Although fenced code blocks don't have to be preceded by a blank line like indented code blocks do, it's recommended
>>>>>>Remember within lists, you have to indent non-fenced code blocks eight spaces to render them properly

## Example

```java
/* HelloWorld.java
 */
public class HelloWorld
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```

    ```java
	```public class HelloWorld
	```{public static void main(String[] args) {
		```System.out.printIn("Hello World!");}
	```}
	```


2. Fenced Code can then add syntax highlighting
>>>In the Fenced Block, add an optional language identifier to run it through syntax highlighting
>>>>>>They use "Linguist" to perform language detection & syntax highlighting

## Example:

```java
public class HelloWorld
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```
